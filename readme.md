     - Build a real-time **AI chatbot** using **ChatGPT API**.
     - Capabilities include:
       - Responding to general queries.
       - Cryptocurrency-related questions (e.g., "What is the price of BTC?").
       - Guiding users on swap operations (e.g., "How do I swap ETH for USD?").
     - Maintain a scrollable chat history with timestamps.
   - **Advanced Features** (Optional):
     - Support slash commands (e.g., `/price BTC`, `/swap ETH USD 1`).
     - Error messages for invalid commands.

#### 3. **Cryptocurrency Insights**
   - **Details**:
     - Fetch and display real-time data using the **CoinGecko API**:
       - Current price of BTC and ETH.
       - 7-day or 30-day price charts (using Chart.js or Recharts).
     - Display a user-friendly interface for cryptocurrency insights.
   - **UI Expectations**:
     - A dedicated dashboard or section for crypto prices and charts.

#### 4. **Real Swap Execution**
   - **Details**:
     - Integrate the **Enso API** to enable real token swaps.
     - User inputs:
       - Source token (dropdown or text input).
       - Target token (dropdown or text input).
       - Amount to swap.
     - Workflow:
       - Validate the userâ€™s wallet balance before executing the swap.
       - Fetch real-time exchange rates from the Enso API.
       - Allow users to confirm the swap, then execute it via the API.
       - Display transaction status and success/failure notifications.
   - **UI Expectations**:
     - A clean modal or dedicated page for swap operations.
     - Display a summary before execution (e.g., "You are swapping 1 ETH for X USD").
     - Show wallet balances for selected tokens.

#### 5. **User-Friendly Dashboard**
   - **Details**:
     - Combine all features into a cohesive, intuitive dashboard.
     - Include:
       - Cryptocurrency price and chart widgets.
       - AI chatbox.
       - Swap section.
     - Provide clear navigation for all functionalities.

#### 6. **Frontend Design**
   - **Details**:
     - Take inspiration from Termix.aiâ€™s minimal and modern UI.
     - Use **TailwindCSS** or **Material-UI** for a clean design.
     - Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
     - Consistent theming across all components.

#### 7. **Code Quality and Modularity**
   - **Details**:
     - Maintain a clean and modular codebase:
       - Separate API calls into a dedicated services folder.
       - Use custom hooks (e.g., `useFetchCryptoData`, `useEnsoSwap`).
       - Reusable components for UI elements.
     - Implement **TypeScript** for better type safety and maintainability.
     - Document code with comments where necessary.
